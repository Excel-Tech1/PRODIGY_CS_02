Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption
This project implements a simple image encryption and decryption system using pixel manipulation techniques. The encryption process involves applying diffusion and substitution algorithms on the RGB channels of an image, allowing users to securely encrypt and decrypt images using a numeric key. This project also includes a Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with Tkinter to make the process user-friendly.
    Encrypt Images: Users can load any image and encrypt it using a diffusion-substitution algorithm with a numeric key.
    Decrypt Images: Encrypted images can be decrypted back to their original form using the same key.
    GUI Interface: The app provides a simple interface where users can select images, enter keys, and perform encryption or decryption.
    Support for RGB and Grayscale Images: The system can handle both grayscale and RGB images, encrypting and decrypting all channels.
    Error Handling: Ensures users enter valid numeric keys and provides clear error messages in case of invalid input.
